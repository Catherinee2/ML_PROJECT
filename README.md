# PREDICTING THE PRICES OF USED CARS IN MACHINE LEARNING 
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as the car's brand, manufacturing year, mileage, engine size, transmission type, and fuel type. By training and evaluating multiple regression models, the project identifies the most effective model for accurate price prediction.
The best-performing model (Gradient Boosting Regressor) achieves a RÂ² Score of 0.9064 and MSE of 4.42B, indicating strong predictive performance and generalization to unseen data.
